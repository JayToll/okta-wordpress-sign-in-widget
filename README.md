# WordPress Okta Sign-In Widget

Replaces the WordPress login screen with the Okta sign-in widget

This is just a proof of concept!

TODO:

* Provide an admin UI for configuring the Okta org and client ID/secret
* Clean up the UX around installing the plugin, like making sure the admin user can still log in after the plugin is activated
* Handle errors better (or at all really)
